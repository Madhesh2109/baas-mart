        <h2>About BAASS Homemade Products</h2>

        <p className="about-text">
          BAASS Homemade Products began as a small home-based effort to prepare
          masalas the way they are traditionally made — using carefully selected
          spices, time-tested methods, and patient grinding.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          Each masala is prepared in small batches to maintain freshness,
          aroma, and taste. We focus on consistency and purity, without
          shortcuts that compromise quality.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          Our products are made with the same care and attention that we use
          in our own kitchen, so you can trust what goes into your food.
        </p>
